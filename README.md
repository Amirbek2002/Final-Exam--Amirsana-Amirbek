# Final-Exam--Amirsana-Amirbek
Final exam

#We did not invent the name of the site ourselves. We took an example of a men's watch website from the Internet. And worked on it. 

#The photo of the logo is no different from the original. Since our goal was to create a toast website exactly like the original, we tried to keep all the objects as the original. But as you can see, we used an image from the Internet, on the title page of the site. 

WI wanted our site to have the most beautiful design and therefore I paid attention even to small details. 
      In the process of work, I used medium, maximum, and small width sizes for site adaptations. 
      And to make my job easier, I used to display a grid. This display really reduces the work.

#Also, in the course of my work, I used different types of fonts in order to attract the attention of viewers, site visitors. 
      Fonts such as: 

- Monospace, Fantasy, Arial;
Font styles:
-italic, normal style;
Font sizes:
-5px;15px;60px;30px;

#I used @Keyframes for animations;

#Libraries for JS:
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js "></script>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="../images/porsche%20logo.png" type="image/png">
    <src script="../Scripts/AdminPageScript.js "></script>
    <src script="../Scripts/siteScript.js "></script>
#My site is for a person who is engaged in sales and such things. 

#auxiliary sites:
URL(https://watchshop.kz/collection/mens);
-for icons:
URL(https://icons8.com/icons);


#Problems arose when changing the width under different types of screens. Then the blocks were jumping back and forth. Then the pictures didn't look right when the changes were made.
